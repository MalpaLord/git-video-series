# git-video-series
This is going to be a basic video ranking website where I can list video series
that I'm watching and have watched and rank them

Version 1.0 - basic list and secondary tabs for all 3 video series
        1.1 - added style.css to better all tabs
            
            In the future I will create a way to add series on the tab
            as well as the way to add this secondary tab and description.
            Finally a ranking system as well as ways to sort the series.
